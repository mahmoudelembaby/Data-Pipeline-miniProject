# Data pipeline â€“ Mini Project on Google Cloud Platform
The idea behind this project is to simulate a real-world scenario where we need to move data from a source to a destination in a big data environment having huge amounts of data in semi-structured and unstructured formats.

- This Project Uses Python, Google Cloud Platform (GCP) and some embedded system device to generate data
